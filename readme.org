This package provides auto-generated wrappers for multiple tree-sitter
grammars, - cpp, java, lua, js, latex, clojure etc (for the full list see
[[https://github.com/haxscramper/htsparse/tree/master/src/htsparse][htsparse module list]]). Each wrapper has two versions - ~core_only~ (does
not depend on most of the hmisc features and only imports [[https://haxscramper.github.io/hmisc/hmisc/wrappers/treesitter_core.html][treesitter_core]]
from hmisc) and more feature-full one.

"core_only" wrapper provides a simple interfaces to the tree-sitter - node
is wrapped in the ~distinct~ type and helper procedures for ~.kind~ are
provided. In order to read and analyze the nodes you can use procedures
defined in the ~treesitter_core~, such as ~[]~ (get idx-th named subnode),
~{}~ (get any idx-th subnode) and ~items~ iterator.

"full" wrapper proviedes an additional convenience layer on top of the bare
tree-sitter, by rewriting ~distinct~ tree into much more useable structure
that supports ~[]~ for named fields (~node["type"]~), stores pointer to the
base string (and has proper ~.strVal()~ call implemented, without the need
to pass original string everywhere), and has more sophisticated
~.treeRepr()~ implementation that is very useuful for understanding the
parsed AST.

Both "full" and "core only" versions include seveal helper types, consts
and procs:

- node kinds :: enum with all possible node kinds. Tree-sitter has two
  different node types - named and unnamed, with named nodes further
  subdivided into regular and [[https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/creating-parsers#hiding-rules][hidden]]. All of these types are listed in the
  single enum. Fields that end with ~Tok~ correspond to the token nodes,
  ones that have ~Hid~ in name are "hidden" (regular parser won't show
  these nodes in the resulting AST).
  - Full list of token nodes can be accessed via ~<lang>HiddenKinds~ constant
  - List of tokens kinds is stored in ~<lang>TokenKinds~
  - Most of the operations hide token nodes by deafult (~.len()~, ~[]~,
    ~items()~ etc). In order to access those, ~unnamed = true~ argument can
    be used. ~node[<idx>, true]~ has a shorthand version - ~{}~ operator.
    In most cases this is not necessary, except for maybe various operators
    that used literal tokens - to properly iterate subnodes of ~1 + 2~ you
    probably need to use ~for sub in items(node, true)~
- allowed subnodes :: Short list of the allowed node kinds for each subnode
  is stored in the ~<lang>AllowedSubnodes~ const
- original grammar :: Most of the original grammar production rules are
  copied into the ~<lang>Grammar~ variable. These rules correspond to the
  original productions in the ~grammar.js~ and might be used to generate
  new source code from the AST.

In addition to the shared features, "full" vesion also includes helpers to

- parse text :: ~parse<lang>String~ - helper proc to convert ~string~ into
  rewritten node. Node the ~unnamed: bool = false~ argument - by default
  only named nodes are rewritten, and resulting tokens are discareded. To
  get full tree rewrite with tokens intact set this argument to true, or
  use ~.getTs()~ for the rewritten node to access the original tree-sitter
  node.

** Tree-sitter library

You need to have tree-sitter runtime library installed. For arch linux it
can be done by installing [[https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/tree-sitter/][tree-sitter]], otherwise you can install it
manually:

#+begin_src sh
  wget https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/archive/0.20.0.tar.gz
  tar -xvf 0.20.0.tar.gz && cd tree-sitter-0.20.0
  sudo make install PREFIX=/usr
#+end_src
